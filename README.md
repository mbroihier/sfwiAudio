# sfwiAudio 

This Android application allows a user to playback audio podcasts.  This is just a prototype at the moment.  My goal with the "sfwi" series of apps is to create simple applications that don't have annoying "features" and constant updates.  I shouldn't have to relearn how to use an app whenever I open it.
